This project allows you to search for locations that are still open nearby your current location. To run the project locally, you will need to go to where the index.html file is and open it with a browser (Ex: Google Chrome). 

When you open the project, the application will look for nearby pizza places in near the SF coordinates. To search for places around you, you will need to enter a input that is not only spaces and click search.

Once you click search, you will see a list of places near you if it is a valid input. You can click on any of the places on the list to see where that location is located on the map. The map will zoom in on that location and a infowindow will pop up.

The application is responsive so you can check this application out on mobile as well as desktop.
